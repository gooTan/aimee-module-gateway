/* gateway_pipeline.h: the canonical request IR + typed stage interface for the
 * universal gateway (P2a). Every proxied model call is wrapped in a `gw_request_t`
 * and run through an ordered list of request stages — bounded, per-call transforms
 * that inspect/alter the request before it is rendered to the serving model's API.
 *
 * This is the SEAM only. The concrete stages (memory/context injection, tool
 * policing) live where their dependencies are (the ingress / the core
 * gateway_policy module); this module just defines the IR and runs the stages in
 * order. It therefore has NO dependency on server types — `driver`/`ag` are carried
 * as opaque pointers that the stage implementations cast back, and `raw` is an
 * opaque `cJSON` the stages mutate. So both ingresses AND the agentic /v1/runs path
 * can share one pipeline without a layering violation.
 *
 * Two phases, kept deliberately distinct:
 *   1. mutation stages  — gw_pipeline_run_request(): each stage rewrites `raw`.
 *   2. terminal render  — the caller, AFTER the pipeline, translates `raw` to the
 *      serving provider's message/tool shape. Render is NOT a stage (it produces a
 *      derived shape rather than mutating `raw`), so stages always see the full,
 *      un-translated request. A future need for a stage to see the post-translate
 *      shape is a response-side concern (P2b), not a P2a request stage.
